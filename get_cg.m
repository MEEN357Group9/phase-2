function cg = get_cg(FSAE_Race_Car)
%This function finds the location of the center of gravity of the car along the 
%X axis given the car data
%
% Inputs:
%       FSAE_Race_car        Is a structure that has the data for quantifying 
%                            the mass matrix
%
% Outputs:
%       cg                   Is a scalar value that gives the location of the 
%                            center of gravity measured from the rear axle to 
%                            the front axle
